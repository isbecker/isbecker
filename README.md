# Hello, I'm Ian ðŸ‘‹

As an experienced software engineer with a deep passion for distributed systems, cloud technologies, and open-source software, I've made my mark by innovating, optimizing, and leading in various technology domains. My expertise in C, C#, Python, and Java, combined with a strong foundation in Linux and Android OS, allows me to craft efficient and secure software solutions.

I have done some streaming of my development on OSS projects on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/beckrdev).
I don't stream much anymore, I just don't find the time these days.

## Curent Projects

### News Reader

Deployed at [https://reader.beckr.dev](https://reader.beckr.dev)

Code at [https://github.com/isbecker/reader](https://github.com/isbecker/reader)

A news reader app that I am writing, using SvelteKit + Typescript + TailwindCSS.

I am using this app to learn these technologies and improve my skills. I also hope that it will become useful to others.

I have streamed the work on my [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/beckrdev). Please feel free to follow along!

My goal is to have a combined feed of my preferred news source - Reddit + Hacker News
